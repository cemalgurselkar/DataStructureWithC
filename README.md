# Data Structures with C
This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the C programming language. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate `.c` file named after the corresponding algorithm.
#### Notes:
- This repo is prepared to help the exams of CENG 213 Data Structure.
- All files are written in C programming language.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run a specific file, you can use the GCC compiler. Below are the steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `.c` file you want to compile.

```bash
#How to run a .c file:
gcc -o main main.c # Create a .exe file of main.c 
./main #run the .exe file (.exe = executive)
```
