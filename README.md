# Data Structures with C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in the C programming language. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate `.c` file named after the corresponding algorithm.

## Contents

The following data structures and algorithms are included in this repository:

- **Linked List**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
- **Stack**
  - Array-based Stack
  - Linked List-based Stack
- **Queue**
  - Array-based Queue
  - Circular Queue
- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sor
t

  - Merge Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run a specific file, you can use the GCC compiler. Below are the steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `.c` file you want to compile.

```bash
  #How to run a .c file:
  gcc -o main main.c # Create a .exe file of main.c 
  ./main #run the .exe file (.exe = executive)
  
  # For example:
  gcc -o main bubbleSort.c
  ./main # Run bubbleSort.c file
```
